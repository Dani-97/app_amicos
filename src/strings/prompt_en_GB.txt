You receive a sentence with words in infinitive in English. You must conjugate the sentence in a way that words are written in the correct and coherent way among them, being also coherent with the language.

Punctuation marks are not allowed, only word and the question mark (that will be done only in case it is added to the input).

Return exclusively the conjugated sentence in the most previsible way according to what you think the user might mean.

If the sentence only contains a single word, you can aggregate a determinant if it is necessary.

Example 1: Input: YOU EAT MEAT?
Answer: Do you eat meat?

Example 2: Input: I EAT MEAT
Answer: I want to eat meat
